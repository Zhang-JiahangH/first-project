     11.2 (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
     Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
     A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired.
     A faculty member has a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
