     (Print the digits in an integer reversely) Write a recursive method that displays an int value reversely on
     the console using the following header: For example, reverseDisplay(12345) displays 54321.

     The original problem asks you to "Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer and
     displays its reversal." but you don't need to do the "Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer"
     portion as you've demonstrate knowledge of that already. I'll continue to remove unneeded program requirements
     to save you time.
